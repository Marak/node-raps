(check it out)

1 (nodejitsu) node.js javascript about to hit you
2 non-blocking, so i/o is never an issue
3 dont cry for ruby on rails ( a ha ) here is a tissue

4 caus its the java-to-the-script doing this since 96'
5 peace to brendan eich for making it exist 

6 open-source license, of course we be frugal
7 peace to lars bak for v8 from google

8 big ups to ry dahl for keeping it real
9 big ups to joyent for paying all the bills

10 but im ma-rock, the new kid on the block 
11 saying invest in nodejitsu, its a top pick stock!

11.5 (check it)

12 node.js allows for real-time sockets ( among other things! )
13 over http, its socket.io and you cannot stop it! ( what )
14 Guerimo from learnboost blowing up like a rocket ( ohh! )
15 just go to the github for the source (if you wanna cop it!)

16 need to install packages, use the module system
17 it was built by isaacs a man of knowledge and wisdom

18 npm install foo, now you rocking
19 require foo in any script you be dropping

20 you see in theory, if you know jquery
21 you can write back-end code in node.js
22 thats crazier then tim leary
23 and thats kinda scurry if you don't know flow control
24 too many asyncronous callbacks, its time to slow you roll

25 try step by tim caswell
26 chainsaw by substack, its just as swell
27 make your node code sane and not looking loopy
28 it's time to send those synchronous ruby

guys to heck, node.js is the hottest tech
if you haven't adopted it, you better protect your neck
( protect ya neck , protect ya neck)
betting against node.js? ( thats a bad bet !)

you see, node blurs the line of the server and client
using battle hardened technologies (javascript) and a community that is reliant
show me a 10 year (javascript) veteran that never threw in the towel
i'll show you a man of immense skill and experience like my friend paolo (nodejitsu)

this is our time, javascript been lurking
with some crazy ninjas in the shadows that be solid working
take the crazy out of javascript, so that shit can rip
( here ) have a refreshing taste of caffeinated coffeescript

drip, drip, drip, thats the sound of OSS 
from document cloud jeremery ashkanes is the best!

from nyc.js im making it clear yo
big ups to indexzero computer science hero
big ups to brian mitchell, and fotoverite
big ups to tmpvar,  his capacity is very
intimidating, there is no debating
if you are a hater, node.js is what are you should be hating
(we're) defacing all of other of the other competitors
it might not be the best, but uhh its better then yours
so do what you will, and say what you say 
( dual-sided javascripts libraries ) today is a new day

so pour a tall glass of mead and (YAAAAAARG) real loud
JAVASCRIPT (motherfucker) say it real proud
and im signing this off with a peace out to cloud (head, head, head, head)

(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

( javascript mothaafuckkka )

( node.js mothhafuckkka )

( nodejitsu motthhafuckkka )

( PEACE )
