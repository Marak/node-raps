caus its the java-to-the-script doing this since 96'
peace to brendan eich for making it exist 

it's an open-source license, of course we be frugal
peace to Lars Bak for v8 from Google

big ups to Ry Dahl for keeping it real
big ups to Joyent for paying all the bills

big ups to Marak, the new kid on the block 
saying invest in nodejitsu, its a top pick stock!

( why? ) node.js allows for real-time sockets
over http, its socket.io and you cannot stop it! 
Guerimo from learnboost blowing up like a rocket
just go to the github for the source (if you wanna cop it!)

need to install packages, use the module system
it was built by isaacs a man of knowledge and wisdom

npm install foo, now you rocking
require foo in any script you be dropping

ohh so you know a little [jQuery](http://jquery.com)?
don't write write node and code 
thats crazier then tim leary
because thats kinda scary if you don't know flow control
too many callbacks, its time to slow you roll

try Step by Tim Caswell
Chainsaw by Substack, it's just as swell
make your node code sane and not looking loopy
Node.js is the best so you better run Ruby.

(Run Ruby Run Ruby Run)
(Run Ruby Run Ruby Run)

so we throw our hands in the air like we don't just care
we wreck with Connect as our middle-ware
using the node-inspector to get up in there
we dance around on Github like Fred Astair, i swear
the Node wiki page is our second home
if it's not open-source yo we leave it alone
Node is the king and he can't be dethroned
Node is the code that's the hottest tech
if you don't have Node you better protect your neck

you see, node blurs the line of the server and client
battle hardened technologies and a community that is reliant
10 year javascript veterans that never threw in the towel
immense skill and experience like my friend paolo

it's javascript time, we own this shhhh
have a refreshing taste of caffeinated coffeescript

drip, drip, drip, thats the sound of OSS 
from document cloud jeremery ashkanes is the best!

from nyc.js im making it clear yo
big ups to indexzero computer science hero
big ups to brian mitchell, and fotoverite
big ups to tmpvar,  his capacity is very
intimidating, there is no debating
if you are a hater, node is what are you should be hating

( javascript mothaafuckkka )
( node.js mothhafuckkka )
( javascript mothaafuckkka )
( nodejitsu motthhafuckkka )

( PEACE )
