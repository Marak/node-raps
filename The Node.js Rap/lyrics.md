( javascript mothaafuckkka )  
( node.js mothhafuckkka )  
( javascript mothaafuckkka )  
( dont cry for rails )  
( nodejitsu motthhafuckkka )  

caus its the java-to-the-script doing this since 96'  
peace to brendan eich for making it exist  

it's an open-source license, of course we be frugal  
peace to Lars Bak for v8 from Google  

big ups to Ry Dahl for keeping it real  
big ups to Joyent for paying all the bills  

big ups to Marak, the new kid on the block  
saying invest in nodejitsu, its a top pick stock!  

( why? ) node.js allows for real-time sockets  
over http, its socket.io and you cannot stop it!  
Guerimo from learnboost blowing up like a rocket  
just go to the github for the source (if you wanna cop it!)  

need to install packages, use the module system  
it was built by isaacs a man of knowledge and wisdom  

npm install foo, now you rocking  
require foo in any script you be dropping  

ohh so you know a little [jQuery](http://jquery.com)?  
don't write write node and code  
thats crazier then Tim Leary  
because thats kinda scary if you don't know flow control  
too many callbacks, its time to slow you roll  

try Step by Tim Caswell  
Chainsaw by Substack, it's just as swell  
make your node code sane and not looking loopy  
Node.js is the best so you better run Ruby.  

(Run Ruby Run Ruby Run)  
(Run Ruby Run Ruby Run)  

so we throw our hands in the air like we don't just care  
we wreck with Connect as our middle-ware  
using the node-inspector to get up in there  
we dance around on Github like Fred Astair, i swear  
the Node wiki page is our second home  
if it's not open-source yo we leave it alone  
Node is the king and he can't be dethroned  
Node is the code that's the hottest tech  
if you don't have Node you better protect your neck  

you see, node blurs the line of the server and client  
battle hardened technologies and a community that is reliant  
10 year javascript veterans that never threw in the towel  
immense skill and experience like my friend paolo  

it's javascript time, we own this shhhh  
have a refreshing taste of caffeinated coffeescript  

drip, drip, drip, thats the sound of OSS  
from document cloud jeremery ashkanes is the best!  

from nyc.js im making it clear yo  
big ups to indexzero computer science hero  
big ups to brian mitchell, and fotoverite  
big ups to tmpvar,  his capacity is very  
intimidating, there is no debating  
if you are a hater, node is what are you should be hating  

( javascript mothaafuckkka )  
( node.js mothhafuckkka )  
( javascript mothaafuckkka )  
( nodejitsu motthhafuckkka )  

( PEACE )
